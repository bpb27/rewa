# TODO

- link oscars w/ actors and crew
- should make an actors_on_oscars and crew_on_oscars table
- many crew involved in oscars

- searching for short title, e.g. "red"
- need to return exact matches first (also show year in movie dropdown)
- also can't click to clear title tokens

- oscars year should be table
  - can take a year range
  - movie | award | won | recipient
  - also be cool to have top movies of that year by popularity / revenue / tmdb avg (can be a dynamic call)
- trpc caching (https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/caching#how-to-cache-responses)
- add more streamer options (Criterion, Tubi)
- xstate update to v5
- more crate and text
- look into suspense for modals + sidebars + dialogs that are loading?
- leaderboard hover show title and year in tooltip
- figure out image console warning
- title in table has extra padding that overlaps table border
- tooltips and popovers should be centered aligned to content
- streamer update strategy (ideally once a week cron)
- a11y
  - accessible button name
  - select label
  - make sure table is navigable
- route types
- basic smoke test
- ditch css modules
