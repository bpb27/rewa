# TODO

# comps and css

- extract prisma movie select logic (needed for item below)
- make MoviePanel that uses MovieCard
- sidebar scroll
- make custom popover for type ahead (and nav)
- cleanup utils folder
- text components
- clickable table header sort?
- render card on mobile by default?
- delete components/ui
- standard button variant
- real nav w/ dropdown
- probably remove css modules
- meta props for sharing

# NICE TO HAVE

- search: director, year, streamer, maybe full crew
- imdb rating / rottenmater rating
- academy awards stuff (not available via TMDB - would be cool to have a dedicated table - doesn't exist anywhere)
- other filter components like year slider, host checklist/typeahead (or filter sidebar)
- person most involved list
- ditch css modules?
- actor viz sensor + search? search on other pages?
