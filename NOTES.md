TODO

- convert top to prisma
- single script to add a new movie + episode
- imdb rating / rotten mater rating
- responsiveness
- general design
- academy awards stuff (not available via TMDB - would be cool to have a dedicated table - doesn't exist anywhere)
- cool animation for top category movie poster rendering (bar then poster reveal?)
- better movie sidebar in top
- maybe try next app router
- maybe get more into react server components
- maybe viz sensor on table so not rendering 280+ rows at once
- other filter components like year slider, host checklist/typeahead
- placeholder image for most appearance deeper cut guys
