# TODO

# comps

- extract prisma movie select logic (needed for item below)
- make MoviePanel that uses MovieCard + scrollable
- cleanup utils folder

# NICE TO HAVE

- search: director, year, streamer, maybe full crew
- imdb rating / rottenmater rating
- academy awards stuff (not available via TMDB - would be cool to have a dedicated table - doesn't exist anywhere)
- other filter components like year slider, host checklist/typeahead (or filter sidebar)
- person most involved list
- ditch css modules?
- actor viz sensor + search? search on other pages?
- probably remove css modules
- render card on mobile by default?
- clickable table header sort?
- text components
