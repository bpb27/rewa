# TODO

- sorting
- getStaticPaths for table page
- oscars
- remove unused utils

# NICE TO HAVE

- more linting rules
- expandable place for description, crew, cast + load more
- imdb rating / rottenmater rating
- filter components like year slider, host checklist/typeahead (or filter sidebar) (would be outside token bar but needs to be QP'd)
- person most involved list
- ditch css modules?
- actor viz sensor + search? search on other pages?
