# TODO

- single script to add a new movie + episode
- sidebar scroll
- card view for table on mobile
- table top bar responsiveness
- clear button in input, or fix onBlur sitch
- more stuff to movie sidebar
- meta props for sharing

# NICE TO HAVE

- imdb rating / rottenmater rating
- academy awards stuff (not available via TMDB - would be cool to have a dedicated table - doesn't exist anywhere)
- other filter components like year slider, host checklist/typeahead (or filter sidebar)
- person most involved list
- ditch css modules?
- actor viz sensor + search? search on other pages?
