# NICE TO HAVE

- imdb rating / rottenmater rating
- academy awards stuff (not available via TMDB - would be cool to have a dedicated table - doesn't exist anywhere)
- other filter components like year slider, host checklist/typeahead (or filter sidebar)
- person most involved list
- ditch css modules?
- actor viz sensor + search? search on other pages?
- clickable table header sort?
