- mode switch in navbar
- top appearances pages + api route filter
- lots of oscar movie cards dont have taglines but do have overviews - need a way to access it
- maxlist box when lots of directors, hosts, oscars, genres
- redo oscar_nominations inserts (need recipient)
- displaying oscars in table

- oscars

  - data is in finally
  - figure out display of awards in table and card
  - need to normalize/format names
  - tokenize oscars
  - maybe tables TDs should have a max with an expandable thing
  - ability to view oscar year (probably via modal)
  - new movie script needs to check for oscars? or the movie will already be there so it should work fine...it will just add the episode

- more composable pieces in scripts - when you import stuff from other files they automatically run

- api routes just stall on errors - need to send something
- accessible button name
- select label
- make sure table is navigable
- lots of clickable things - probably need to add role button + aria label

- more boxes
- crew sidebar

# NICE TO HAVE

- more linting rules
- expandable place for description, crew, cast + load more
- imdb rating / rottenmater rating
- filter components like year slider, host checklist/typeahead (or filter sidebar) (would be outside token bar but needs to be QP'd)
- person most involved list
- ditch css modules?
- actor viz sensor + search? search on other pages?
